# CONTEXT — ZomboidControl

Complete state of the project. Read this first; append after every task.

---

## What this is

A web interface for administering Project Zomboid dedicated servers. Symfony
as a JSON API, React as the frontend, deployed as one Docker container plus
PostgreSQL — locally, on a server, or in Coolify.

**It will be published for anyone to self-host.** The people running it are
server operators, not developers. Anything that assumes technical knowledge —
a DSN, an environment variable, a DNS record — has to be either avoided or
explained in the interface. This has already shaped several decisions and
should keep doing so.

Work is split into sub-projects; see `docs/superpowers/briefs/`.
Sub-projects 01 through 04 are complete. 05 (live map), 06 (roles) and
07 (event console) are not started.

---

## Next concrete step

**Everything in `TODO.md` is done.** All six items were built and
verified on 2026-09-04; `TODO.md` now records what came of each. What
remains open is listed at the end of this section.

Three assumptions in that list turned out to be wrong, and each
correction is worth more than the code it changed:

**1. Teleport to coordinates works over RCON.** `teleportto` has two
argument forms; only the first fails.

- `teleportto x,y,z` — one argument, moves whoever typed it. RCON has
  nobody, so the server answers a bare `Error`. This is what misled the
  first attempt.
- `teleportto "name" x,y,z` — **two arguments, moves a named player.**
  Verified live: *"admin teleported to 10778,9770,0 please wait two
  seconds to show the map around you."* Quotes optional, coordinates
  comma-separated without spaces.

The command class confirms it independently: its capability is named
`TeleportToCoordinates`.

**2. Hordes and zombie removal need no bridge.** `createhorde2` and
`removezombies` are varargs taking `-count -x -y -z -radius`, so both
work over RCON at any point in the world. Verified live:
`removezombies -x 10778 -y 9770 -z 0 -radius 30` answers *"Zombies
removed."* `createhorde2` with the same flags answers *"invalid
location"* when no player is nearby — the flag form parses, but the
chunk has to be loaded. The interface says so.

**3. The world map needs no renderer and no foreign tiles.** The
research pointed at two dead ends: rendering the world isometrically
costs about 404 GB, and pzmap.org's tiles are barred by their own
`robots.txt` and blocked outright by a `cross-origin-resource-policy`
header.

Neither is needed. **Project Zomboid draws its own in-game map and
ships the result**: `media/maps/Muldraugh, KY/pyramid.zip` holds 6582
tiles of 256 pixels in five levels, 51 MB in all. Level 0 is
19968x16128 — exactly the world in squares — so one pixel is one square
and one tile is one cell. A player's position needs no projection.

Only the main map carries a pyramid; the other eleven directories are
start areas inside it.

### What is still open

- **The two-way bridge.** Everything in brief 07 marked "bridge" —
  snow, fog, wind, temperature, the in-game clock, time speed,
  electricity and water, placed sounds, safehouse and faction
  management — still needs the panel to ask the server to do something
  rather than only read what it wrote. The reference panel's approach
  is analysed in detail below under "The reference panel's two-way
  bridge"; that analysis is the starting point.

- **Moving the access checks onto permissions.** Roles carrying
  permissions exist and are editable, but every controller still guards
  with `ROLE_SERVER_ADMIN` or `ROLE_ADMIN`. The voter grants a
  permission from an assigned role *or* from a legacy role name, so
  both are in force and checks can move one at a time. Nothing is
  broken until they do; a custom role simply does not restrict anything
  yet.

- **Assigning roles in the interface.** The API takes `assignedRoles`
  on a user and reports the permissions they hold, but the account
  dialog does not offer them yet.

### Not yet built

- The two-way bridge — the last piece of brief 07
- Moving the access checks from role names onto permissions
- Assigning roles to users in the interface (the API takes them already)

### Known open risks

1. **The bridge is one-way.** It writes; nothing reads a command from the
   panel. What is left of brief 07 waits on this — see "The reference
   panel's two-way bridge" for how the other panel solves it.
2. **A custom role does not restrict anything yet.** Permissions exist and
   are editable, but every controller still guards with a legacy role
   name. The voter honours both, so nothing is broken; the restriction
   simply has no effect until the checks move over.
3. **Map tiles are the operator's own artefact.** `app:map:import` needs a
   path to `media/maps` from a game or server installation. The map says
   so and names the command when the tiles are missing.
4. **Mail lands in spam** without DKIM. Not a defect — see the DNS section
   — but new operators will hit it. The deliverability check now names the
   exact record.

## The user's server, for testing

- Server name in the panel: "GTX Gaming", host `176.57.168.46`
- FTP/SFTP and RCON both configured and verified
- Bridge installed and running
- Base path contains the Zomboid data folders directly: `Logs`, `Saves`,
  `Server`, `media`, `db` — **not** under a `~/Zomboid` subdirectory
- Bridge status file: `Lua/ZomboidControl/status.json` relative to the base
  path
- Test account: `a.gerhardt1987@gmail.com`, password
  `ein-ausreichend-langes-passwort`, roles ROLE_ADMIN + ROLE_SERVER_ADMIN,
  with Google, Steam and one passkey linked

**Credentials rule the user set:** never read or print stored credentials,
environment values or passwords. Checking whether a value is set is fine;
printing it is not.

---

## Facts established by research

Checked against primary sources. Do not re-litigate without new evidence.

### Symfony 7.4 is forced

`scheb/2fa-bundle` v8.6.1 requires `symfony ^7.4` on `php ~8.4.0`.
`DoctrineEncryptBundle` 7.0.x requires the same independently. Native SSE
classes arrived in 7.3.

### Sessions, not JWT

`scheb/2fa` documents that the firewall must be stateful. WebAuthn stores its
challenge in the session. `EventSource` cannot send an `Authorization` header.
Same-origin removes the CORS argument for tokens.

### `SameSite=Lax`, not `Strict`

`Strict` withholds the cookie on the Steam OpenID cross-site return.

### Zomboid, verified against projectzomboid.jar build 42.20.2 with javap

Confirmed present and used by the bridge:

- `getFileWriter(filename, createIfNull, append)` → writes to the Zomboid data
  folder; **creates missing subdirectories on its own** (verified live)
- `getOnlinePlayers()` → `ArrayList<IsoPlayer>`, iterate with `size()`/`get(i)`
- `getUsername()`, `getSteamID()` (**a `long`, not a string**), `getX/Y/Z()`,
  `getHealth()`, `getHoursSurvived()`, `getAccessLevel()`, `getBodyDamage()`
- `BodyDamage`: **`isInfected()` lowercase** for the flag,
  `getApparentInfectionLevel()` for the value. `getInfectionLevel()` does not
  exist, and `IsInfected()` capitalised is a different method.
- `getPerkList()` → `PerkInfo` with `.perk:getId()` and `:getLevel()`
- `getCharacterTraits():getKnownTraits()` → list with `:getName()`
- `getTimestamp()` wraps `System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000` — real wall-clock
  seconds. `getTimestampMs()` and `getTimeInMillis()` are the same thing in
  milliseconds. **`getGametimeTimestamp()` is in-game time despite the name.**
- `Events.OnTick` fires on a dedicated server, but **not at a fixed rate**.
  `GameServer` compiles in `FPS = 10` and holds it with a 100 ms
  `UpdateLimit`, which is a ceiling: under load a cycle takes longer and the
  event fires less often. Measured live: 10/s on an empty server, 5/s with one
  player. There is no server option for it — `ServerFramerate`, `UPS` and
  `MaxFramerate` do not exist in `ServerOptions`.
  **Never count ticks for a real-time interval; compare `getTimestamp()`.**

Hard limits:

- **No server-side chat event.** `OnAddMessage` is client-only, and
  `ChatServer` (package `zombie.network.chat`, not `zombie.chat`) never calls
  `LuaEventManager.triggerEvent` at all. Chat is read from the `_chat.txt` log
  and sent via RCON `servermsg`.
- **Player messages are logged, but as a Java `toString()`.** `ChatServer`
  writes `Got message:ChatMessage{chat=<tabKey>, author='<name>',
  text='<text>'}`, then the same message again as `Message ... sent to chat
  (id = N) members` — so every message appears twice and the duplicate has to
  be dropped. Nothing is escaped, so the text can contain `'` and `}`; the
  author runs to the first `', text='` and the text to the last `'}`.
  `chat=` holds a translation key, not "Say" or "Shout", so the chat type is
  only recoverable through the numeric id and the `"<Type> chat has id = N"`
  lines written at startup.
- **The Discord bridge has a third shape**: `Got message '<msg>' by author
  '<author>' from discord`.
- **Chat logging cannot be switched off.** `ServerOptions` has `GlobalChat`,
  `ChatStreams`, `ChatMessageCharacterLimit` and others, but no `ChatLogs`.
- **`servermsg` is the only chat command over RCON.** Nothing sends to one
  player, and nothing sends under a chosen name — `ChatServer` can do both in
  Java, but neither is reachable from RCON.
- **Log lines are stamped `dd-MM-yy HH:mm:ss.SSS`** by `ZLogger`, with the
  level in a second bracket only when the caller passed one.
- **No HTTP, no sockets in Lua.** The file bridge is mandatory.
- **Lua CAN read and write binary**, contrary to what this file said for
  a while. `getGameFilesInput(path)` returns a `DataInputStream`,
  `getFileInput(path)` likewise, and `getFileOutput(path)` a
  `DataOutputStream`. `getFileWriter` is merely the text one.
  **Paths for `getGameFilesInput` need the `media/` prefix** —
  `media/inventory/BerettaClip.png` opens, `inventory/BerettaClip.png`
  does not. Proven end to end on 2026-09-04: the bridge read that PNG
  byte by byte and wrote it back through `getFileOutput`; the panel
  fetched 420 bytes with a valid PNG signature, a readable 34×32 image.
- **The `Every*` events run on in-game time, not real time.** `EveryOneMinute`
  fires when a game minute passes, which depends on the sandbox day length and
  stops entirely while the server is paused. `EveryTenMinutes`, `EveryHours`
  and `EveryDays` do exist and do fire server-side (`GameTime.update()`), but
  none of them is usable as a real-time timer.
- **No server-side join or leave event.** `OnPlayerConnect` and
  `OnPlayerDisconnect` do not exist; `OnConnected` and `OnDisconnect` are
  client-only. The bridge compares the roster on every tick instead and writes
  the moment it differs.
- **`getMaxPlayers()` needs an argument on a server.** Its documented
  zero-argument form is client-side, and calling it bare throws "Not enough
  arguments", which took the whole file down with it. Read `getServerOptions()`
  instead.
- **RCON replies are free text**, not JSON.
- **No RCON command lists bans** — only `banuser`/`unbanuser`. The panel keeps
  its own record, which is why `moderation_action` exists.
- **`banuser` takes no duration.** Timed bans are the panel's own doing: ban
  permanently, lift later by scheduler.
- **`mod.info` is not needed** when the Lua file goes straight into the
  server's own `media/lua/server`. It is only required for mods under `mods/`.

### Interface libraries

- ReUI's catalogue is readable without a licence; its **77 UI components
  install freely**, its **1638 page blocks return 401**.
- shadcn's `marker` is an ARIA text marker, **not** a map component.

## Findings from implementation

Things that cost time and would cost it again.

**Doctrine types cannot be constructor-injected.** The cipher reaches
`EncryptedStringType` through a Doctrine middleware; kernel and console events
do not fire for migrations or tests.

**WebAuthn has two handler contracts.** The firewall wants Symfony's
`AuthenticationSuccessHandlerInterface`; registration wants the bundle's own
`SuccessHandler`.

**`CanSaveCredentialRecord` is required**, or the bundle validates a ceremony
and stores nothing, answering 501.

**Lazily loaded collections read zero.** The last-passkey rule counted through
a collection and would have let an account lock itself out.

**Logout redirected.** A `LogoutEvent` listener answers JSON instead.

**`/app` without a trailing slash 404s** on both Vite and Apache. Both OAuth
authenticators redirect to `/app/`, and a dev-server middleware redirects the
bare path.

**Vite must build into `backend/public/app`.** It built into `frontend/dist`,
which Apache never serves, so the `.htaccess` SPA fallback looped until Apache
gave up with a 500. The production path had never worked.

**RCON needed a hard deadline.** The library's timeout bounds individual
reads, not the exchange; with `max_execution_time=0` a silent port held a
worker indefinitely. Now: `default_socket_timeout` during the call, a
twelve-second deadline, `set_time_limit(20)` as backstop. A silent port raises
`InvalidPacketException`, which is classified as unreachable, not as a failed
command.

**The OAuth client bundle cannot see runtime credentials.** Google's client is
built by a factory at call time. An earlier attempt used a kernel.request
listener that was never registered and silently did nothing —
`debug:event-dispatcher` showed it absent.

**scheb needs every token type listed.** `WebauthnToken` had to be added to
`security_tokens`, or a passkey login skips the second factor.

**The TOTP provider is off until configured.** Without a `totp:` section the
`TotpAuthenticatorInterface` service does not exist and autowiring fails.

**Flex skipped several recipes** (`symfony/apache-pack`, the WebAuthn bundle,
the OAuth bundle). `.htaccess` and `bundles.php` entries were written by hand.

**`node_modules` are platform-bound.** Installed for Linux in the container;
running npm on the host fails with missing native bindings.

## The reference panel's two-way bridge

The panel under `reference/zomboid-control-panel` (gitignored, MIT, read
but never copied) solves the two-way problem this project still has open.
Its `PanelBridge.lua` is 9132 lines and its changelog is a catalogue of
mistakes worth not repeating. Analysed 2026-09-04; the essentials:

**A write restriction that may or may not apply here.** Its changelog
says Build 42 buildid 24449161 (2026-07-29) restricted `getFileWriter`
to a small set of extensions and refuses `.json` outright, returning
nil. It works around this by appending `.txt` to every path it writes
(`status.json.txt`), leaving the content JSON.

**This project's bridge writes plain `.json` and it works.** Verified
2026-09-04 against the live GTX server: `players.json` carried a
timestamp from moments earlier while the server was running. So either
the restriction was lifted, or it never applied to that server's build.
Worth remembering if writes ever start failing silently, but not worth
pre-emptively changing.

`getFileReader` is unaffected either way. The panel writes the files it
owns (`inbox/cmd-*.json`) under their plain names, because it writes
from outside the game's sandbox.

**Directories cannot be created from Lua in Build 42.** The panel has to
create `inbox/` and `outbox/` itself.

**The queue.** Two counters, each owned by exactly one side and read by
the other: the bridge keeps `lastCommandSeq` in its own state file, the
panel keeps `nextCommandSeq` in its own. Command files are named
`cmd-<10-digit-seq>.json` and written atomically (temp file plus
rename), because a half-written file would otherwise be read.

Three separate guards stop a command running twice: the sequence
cursor, setting `lastCommandSeq` *before* the handler runs (a crash
therefore loses a command rather than repeating it), and a set of
already-seen command ids.

**Resync is forward-only.** If the two counters drift — the documented
case is a redeployed panel whose state file was reset while the mod kept
counting — every command waits forever on a file that will never
appear. The bridge reads the panel's declared position after 10 seconds
stuck and moves *forward* to it, never backward. The reasoning is the
part worth keeping: a stale read of the other side's counter can only
ever be too low, never invented too high, so a forward-only jump cannot
replay a command that already ran.

**Every gap in a sequential numbering must be filled actively.** When
its result buffer overflows it writes a tombstone result for the
dropped number rather than skipping it, because the reader is strictly
sequential and would otherwise wait forever.

**A heartbeat that does not travel the command path proves nothing.**
Its status file is written outside the queue, so it reported healthy
while every command was stuck. It now carries the queue counters.

**Not thrown is not succeeded.** Most of its changelog is one mistake in
different clothes: an action reporting success while doing nothing.
`triggerCustomWeatherStage` returns a real boolean that was discarded;
a fallback chain put a method that never throws first, so the real one
was never reached.

**Whether a value can be read back has to be settled per method.**
`ClimateFloat.getFinalValue()` is not refreshed until the next game
tick, so reading it straight after writing proves nothing — but
`getAdminValue()` is a plain field read and does. `permanentlyRemove()`
removes from the live collection synchronously, so re-checking works
there. Both look identical in Lua and behave oppositely.

**Java methods are not always Lua fields.** Guarding with
`if obj.method then` reports false for methods that are callable. This
made a live server with 21 vehicles report zero.

---

## Mail deliverability

The first real test message reached the user's inbox but landed in spam. The
cause is DNS on the sending domain, not the application:

- SPF is `v=spf1 a mx ptr ?all` — does not cover Hetzner's relay, and `ptr` is
  deprecated. Should be `v=spf1 include:_spf.hetzner.com mx ~all`.
- DMARC has `pct=50`, checking only half the mail.
- **DKIM is absent entirely** — the heaviest factor. Enabled per domain in
  Hetzner's konsoleH.

On the application side: mail now carries an HTML part alongside text, names
the application, and says why it arrived. A checker endpoint reads the three
records and reports what is missing.

**Hetzner shared hosting note:** the outgoing server is `mail.your-server.de`
for every mailbox regardless of domain. Entering the own domain fails with a
certificate mismatch, since the certificate covers `*.your-server.de`.

### 2026-09-04 — Mail deliverability and password visibility
HTML mail templates, an SPF/DKIM/DMARC checker, and a reveal toggle on every
password field. Commit `4e24f67`.

### 2026-09-04 — Teleport to coordinates
`teleportto` has two argument forms and only the single-argument one fails
over RCON, because it moves the caller and RCON has none. `PlayerModerator`
gained `teleportToCoordinates()`, the endpoint takes `{x, y, z}` as an
alternative to `{target}`, and the dialog has two tabs plus six landmarks.
The note claiming coordinates were impossible is gone. Commit `52eba8e`.

### 2026-09-04 — Event console
`App\Server\Events`: a catalogue of 14 actions declared once with their
fields and handed to the interface, so a control and its command cannot
drift. Each is marked with the commands it needs and greyed out when the
server's own `help` does not report them.

Two argument forms came from the command classes rather than guesswork:
`createhorde2` and `removezombies` are varargs taking `-x -y -z -radius`,
which is why hordes are RCON here rather than waiting for the bridge, and
`gunshot`/`alarm` take no argument at all.

Verified live: rain started and stopped from the page, and the action was
recorded with time and author. `removezombies` answered "Zombies removed."
`createhorde2` answers "invalid location" without a player nearby — the
flags parse, the chunk has to be loaded — and the page says so.
Commits `48da285`, `f8879ce`.

### 2026-09-04 — Texture pack upload
A rented server ships no texture packs, so `app:icons:extract` served only
operators running the panel beside the game. Packs can now be uploaded in
the settings. `apiFetch` had to learn to pass `FormData` through untouched:
setting a content type of its own strips the multipart boundary.
Verified with a real pack through the browser. Commit `a1b3dae`.

### 2026-09-04 — Roles carrying permissions
Brief 06. A `Role` entity with 17 permissions in five groups, editable in
the interface, assignable to users. Three built-in roles refuse deletion so
an installation cannot lock itself out, and keep their identifiers when
renamed because code refers to them by name.

Permissions and the legacy role names are both in force, as the brief asks:
`PermissionVoter` grants from an assigned role *or* from a legacy name, so
checks can move over one at a time and nothing breaks in the meantime.
Commit `4f1970d`.

### 2026-09-04 — World map
The research offered two dead ends — rendering the world isometrically costs
about 404 GB, and pzmap.org's tiles are barred by their `robots.txt` and
blocked by a `cross-origin-resource-policy` header.

Neither is needed: **the game ships its own map**. `pyramid.zip` holds 6582
tiles of 256 pixels in five levels, 51 MB, and level 0 is 19968x16128 —
exactly the world in squares, so no projection is needed at all.

`MapTileStore` reads a tile straight out of the archive (a zip's central
directory is an index, so unpacking 6582 files would buy nothing).
`app:map:import` takes the archive from a game or server installation.

Two things had to line up in Leaflet, each wrong once against the browser
before it was right: `CRS.Simple` puts one unit on one pixel at zoom 0 while
the pyramid's finest level is the *highest* zoom, and Simple's y axis runs
upward while tile rows run downward — which left every requested row
negative. Verified by measuring what sits under the viewport centre:
searching 11800,6900 lands on 11800,6900. Commit `d7b9db0`.
