# CONTEXT — ZomboidControl

Complete state of the project. Read this first; append after every task.

---

## What this is

A web interface for administering Project Zomboid dedicated servers. Symfony
as a JSON API, React as the frontend, deployed as one Docker container plus
PostgreSQL — locally, on a server, or in Coolify.

**It will be published for anyone to self-host.** The people running it are
server operators, not developers. Anything that assumes technical knowledge —
a DSN, an environment variable, a DNS record — has to be either avoided or
explained in the interface. This has already shaped several decisions and
should keep doing so.

Work is split into sub-projects; see `docs/superpowers/briefs/`.
Sub-projects 01 through 04 are complete. 05 (live map), 06 (roles) and
07 (event console) are not started.

---

## Next concrete step

**The isometric map, one bug from working.** Everything else on the
task list is done and verified against the live server.

### Where it stands

The renderer works. `pzmap2dzi` produces exactly what was asked for --
interiors with furniture, shelves, machinery, the "Welcome to West
Point" sign. Confirmed by eye on 2026-09-05 and shown in the panel.

The panel side is complete: it reads a render's own `map_info.json`,
lists the floors from the files, serves tiles behind its own
authentication, and offers a toggle between the two projections that
appears only when a render exists.

### The one thing that does not work

`GET /api/map/isometric/layer0_files/22/1332_459.jpg` answers **404 in
0.0 seconds** when the tile is absent. It should notice, render the
cells behind it and answer with the result.

**The cause is confirmed**, checked 2026-09-05:

    ddev exec "ls <renderer>/main.py"   -> No such file or directory
    ddev exec "which python3"            -> /usr/bin/python3

Python is in the container. The renderer and the game files are not:
they live on the host, and PHP runs in ddev. `TileRenderer::isAvailable()`
therefore returns false and the endpoint falls through to 404 without
ever trying.

**This is architectural, not a typo.** Think it through before
patching: the panel container cannot render, because rendering needs a
full game installation with the client texture packs. Options are a
sidecar container with the game files mounted, a small render service
on the host that the panel calls, or accepting that the deepest level
is pre-rendered after all.

### The numbers that decide the design

Measured on a real render of one cell, not estimated:

| Vorrat | Size (whole world) |
|---|---|
| everything, full resolution | 438 GB |
| without level 22 | **102 GB** |
| without levels 21 and 22 | **26 GB** |
| up to level 18 only | **2.7 GB** |

Level 22 alone is 336 GB -- three quarters. Each level quarters the one
below. One cell renders in **about one second** on 14 cores. Dropping
level 22 from the test render took it from 110 MB to 28 MB.

The ceiling is a Coolify server: 26 GB was called too much, which is
why on-demand rendering matters.

### How to render, for whoever picks this up

    cd <renderer>
    <venv>/bin/python main.py unpack     # once: extracts the textures
    <venv>/bin/python main.py render base

`unpack` is the step that is easy to miss -- without it every tile
comes out `.empty` and the log says "Missing texture". The venv needs
lupa, pyclipper, kaitaistruct, pillow, pyyaml, requests, flask,
waitress, ruamel.yaml **and setuptools**, the last because Python 3.12
removed distutils and `main.py` imports it.

Settings that matter, in `conf/conf.yaml`: `pz_root`, `output_root`,
`render_cell_range` (a list of `[x, y]` or `[x, y, w, h]`),
`layer_range`, `omit_levels`.

### Ruled out, with reasons

**projectzomboidmap.com's tiles.** Investigated in full on 2026-09-05.
Reachable, and the site uses the same tool this panel does -- but CORS
is allowlisted to their own domain, there is no imprint or contact to
ask, the operator has no rights from The Indie Stone to grant, and the
tile path carries a version stamp that would break a shipped panel for
everyone at once. See brief 08.

**The other panel's approach.** `fpsacha/zomboid-control-panel` proxies
`tiles.pzmap.org` and caches to disk, with no word anywhere about
licensing. Its disk-cache idea is worth borrowing; its source is not.

## Current state — 2026-09-04

### Verified working, against a real server where possible

| Area | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Symfony 7.4.18 on PHP 8.4.24 | running in ddev |
| PostgreSQL 17.11 | migrated |
| Credential encryption | tests prove no plaintext reaches the database |
| Setup wizard | creates the first admin, then refuses |
| Password login | session survives reload |
| Passkeys | registration, login, management; virtual authenticator |
| TOTP two-factor | setup, login, recovery codes; real codes in a browser |
| Google sign-in | **tested by the user against real credentials** |
| Steam sign-in | **tested by the user; SteamID64 stored** |
| Invitations, password reset | endpoints and screens |
| FTP/SFTP to the game server | **works against the user's GTX Gaming server** |

| Lua bridge | **uploaded, loaded, writing correct player data** |
| Player list | **verified live: position, health, access level, skills** |
| Moderation | kick, ban, unban, access level; timed bans via scheduler |
| Mail sending | **user received a test message** |
| Mail deliverability check | SPF, DKIM, DMARC with the exact record to publish |
| Account administration | roles, activation, deletion; last admin protected |
| Server log | **tailed live over FTP, all seven kinds found automatically** |
| Chat | **sent from the panel, read back out of the log within 3s** |
| RCON console | **60 commands read from the live server, syntax checked** |
| Item catalogue | **5,092 items, 5,138 German names, from the live server** |
| Item icons | **4,343 of 5,092 extracted from the texture packs** |
| Giving items | **an axe and 150 nails delivered into a player's inventory** |
| World state | **in-game date, time, weather read from the bridge** |
| Teleport to coordinates | **`teleportto "name" x,y,z` answered live** |
| Event console | **rain started and stopped on the live server from the page** |
| Zombie removal | **`removezombies` with -x/-y/-radius answered "Zombies removed."** |
| Texture pack upload | **a real pack uploaded through the browser, icons extracted** |
| Roles and permissions | 17 permissions in five groups, three built-in roles |
| World map | **the game's own tiles; searching 11800,6900 lands on 11800,6900** |
| Two-way bridge | **a command answered in 1.5s; setting the hour put it in the world** |
| Vehicles and factions | bridge 0.10.0 writes them; empty until players load chunks |
| Live world reading | `readSurroundings` built, not yet exercised with a player online |
| Map from the server | **51 MB pulled over FTP; the server was 36 builds newer than the local game** |
| OpenSeadragon map | **deep links, floor control, layer toggles, right-click teleport** |
| Isometric render | **produces interiors; one cell in ~1s; not yet wired for on demand** |
| Production image | **builds, starts healthy, serves the whole panel** |

380 backend tests, 78 frontend tests. Both suites green.

### Not yet built

- **On-demand tile rendering from inside the container** — see "Next
  concrete step". The renderer works; reaching it from PHP does not.
- **Death locations as a map layer** — the fourth layer a design draft
  asked for. The log has the data; nothing reads it yet.
- **Automatic map import on server restart** — the bridge already
  stamps a session id, so a restart is detectable; the import endpoint
  exists but nothing triggers it.
- **Zombies as a map layer** — deliberately absent: `getZombieList()`
  is in the API index but the game never calls it from Lua anywhere, so
  a layer built on it might silently stay empty. Test it against a live
  server before building it.

### Known open risks

1. **The bridge is one-way.** It writes; nothing reads a command from the
   panel. What is left of brief 07 waits on this — see "The reference
   panel's two-way bridge" for how the other panel solves it.
2. **A custom role does not restrict anything yet.** Permissions exist and
   are editable, but every controller still guards with a legacy role
   name. The voter honours both, so nothing is broken; the restriction
   simply has no effect until the checks move over.
3. **Map tiles are the operator's own artefact.** `app:map:import` needs a
   path to `media/maps` from a game or server installation. The map says
   so and names the command when the tiles are missing.
4. **Mail lands in spam** without DKIM. Not a defect — see the DNS section
   — but new operators will hit it. The deliverability check now names the
   exact record.

## The user's server, for testing

- Server name in the panel: "GTX Gaming", host `176.57.168.46`
- FTP/SFTP and RCON both configured and verified
- Bridge installed and running
- Base path contains the Zomboid data folders directly: `Logs`, `Saves`,
  `Server`, `media`, `db` — **not** under a `~/Zomboid` subdirectory
- Bridge status file: `Lua/ZomboidControl/status.json` relative to the base
  path
- Test account: `a.gerhardt1987@gmail.com`, password
  `ein-ausreichend-langes-passwort`, roles ROLE_ADMIN + ROLE_SERVER_ADMIN,
  with Google, Steam and one passkey linked

**Credentials rule the user set:** never read or print stored credentials,
environment values or passwords. Checking whether a value is set is fine;
printing it is not.

---

## Facts established by research

Checked against primary sources. Do not re-litigate without new evidence.

### Symfony 7.4 is forced

`scheb/2fa-bundle` v8.6.1 requires `symfony ^7.4` on `php ~8.4.0`.
`DoctrineEncryptBundle` 7.0.x requires the same independently. Native SSE
classes arrived in 7.3.

### Sessions, not JWT

`scheb/2fa` documents that the firewall must be stateful. WebAuthn stores its
challenge in the session. `EventSource` cannot send an `Authorization` header.
Same-origin removes the CORS argument for tokens.

### `SameSite=Lax`, not `Strict`

`Strict` withholds the cookie on the Steam OpenID cross-site return.

### Zomboid, verified against projectzomboid.jar build 42.20.2 with javap

Confirmed present and used by the bridge:

- `getFileWriter(filename, createIfNull, append)` → writes to the Zomboid data
  folder; **creates missing subdirectories on its own** (verified live)
- `getOnlinePlayers()` → `ArrayList<IsoPlayer>`, iterate with `size()`/`get(i)`
- `getUsername()`, `getSteamID()` (**a `long`, not a string**), `getX/Y/Z()`,
  `getHealth()`, `getHoursSurvived()`, `getAccessLevel()`, `getBodyDamage()`
- `BodyDamage`: **`isInfected()` lowercase** for the flag,
  `getApparentInfectionLevel()` for the value. `getInfectionLevel()` does not
  exist, and `IsInfected()` capitalised is a different method.
- `getPerkList()` → `PerkInfo` with `.perk:getId()` and `:getLevel()`
- `getCharacterTraits():getKnownTraits()` → list with `:getName()`
- `getTimestamp()` wraps `System.currentTimeMillis() / 1000` — real wall-clock
  seconds. `getTimestampMs()` and `getTimeInMillis()` are the same thing in
  milliseconds. **`getGametimeTimestamp()` is in-game time despite the name.**
- `Events.OnTick` fires on a dedicated server, but **not at a fixed rate**.
  `GameServer` compiles in `FPS = 10` and holds it with a 100 ms
  `UpdateLimit`, which is a ceiling: under load a cycle takes longer and the
  event fires less often. Measured live: 10/s on an empty server, 5/s with one
  player. There is no server option for it — `ServerFramerate`, `UPS` and
  `MaxFramerate` do not exist in `ServerOptions`.
  **Never count ticks for a real-time interval; compare `getTimestamp()`.**

Hard limits:

- **No server-side chat event.** `OnAddMessage` is client-only, and
  `ChatServer` (package `zombie.network.chat`, not `zombie.chat`) never calls
  `LuaEventManager.triggerEvent` at all. Chat is read from the `_chat.txt` log
  and sent via RCON `servermsg`.
- **Player messages are logged, but as a Java `toString()`.** `ChatServer`
  writes `Got message:ChatMessage{chat=<tabKey>, author='<name>',
  text='<text>'}`, then the same message again as `Message ... sent to chat
  (id = N) members` — so every message appears twice and the duplicate has to
  be dropped. Nothing is escaped, so the text can contain `'` and `}`; the
  author runs to the first `', text='` and the text to the last `'}`.
  `chat=` holds a translation key, not "Say" or "Shout", so the chat type is
  only recoverable through the numeric id and the `"<Type> chat has id = N"`
  lines written at startup.
- **The Discord bridge has a third shape**: `Got message '<msg>' by author
  '<author>' from discord`.
- **Chat logging cannot be switched off.** `ServerOptions` has `GlobalChat`,
  `ChatStreams`, `ChatMessageCharacterLimit` and others, but no `ChatLogs`.
- **`servermsg` is the only chat command over RCON.** Nothing sends to one
  player, and nothing sends under a chosen name — `ChatServer` can do both in
  Java, but neither is reachable from RCON.
- **Log lines are stamped `dd-MM-yy HH:mm:ss.SSS`** by `ZLogger`, with the
  level in a second bracket only when the caller passed one.
- **No HTTP, no sockets in Lua.** The file bridge is mandatory.
- **Lua CAN read and write binary**, contrary to what this file said for
  a while. `getGameFilesInput(path)` returns a `DataInputStream`,
  `getFileInput(path)` likewise, and `getFileOutput(path)` a
  `DataOutputStream`. `getFileWriter` is merely the text one.
  **Paths for `getGameFilesInput` need the `media/` prefix** —
  `media/inventory/BerettaClip.png` opens, `inventory/BerettaClip.png`
  does not. Proven end to end on 2026-09-04: the bridge read that PNG
  byte by byte and wrote it back through `getFileOutput`; the panel
  fetched 420 bytes with a valid PNG signature, a readable 34×32 image.
- **The `Every*` events run on in-game time, not real time.** `EveryOneMinute`
  fires when a game minute passes, which depends on the sandbox day length and
  stops entirely while the server is paused. `EveryTenMinutes`, `EveryHours`
  and `EveryDays` do exist and do fire server-side (`GameTime.update()`), but
  none of them is usable as a real-time timer.
- **No server-side join or leave event.** `OnPlayerConnect` and
  `OnPlayerDisconnect` do not exist; `OnConnected` and `OnDisconnect` are
  client-only. The bridge compares the roster on every tick instead and writes
  the moment it differs.
- **`getMaxPlayers()` needs an argument on a server.** Its documented
  zero-argument form is client-side, and calling it bare throws "Not enough
  arguments", which took the whole file down with it. Read `getServerOptions()`
  instead.
- **RCON replies are free text**, not JSON.
- **No RCON command lists bans** — only `banuser`/`unbanuser`. The panel keeps
  its own record, which is why `moderation_action` exists.
- **`banuser` takes no duration.** Timed bans are the panel's own doing: ban
  permanently, lift later by scheduler.
- **`mod.info` is not needed** when the Lua file goes straight into the
  server's own `media/lua/server`. It is only required for mods under `mods/`.

### Interface libraries

- ReUI's catalogue is readable without a licence; its **77 UI components
  install freely**, its **1638 page blocks return 401**.
- shadcn's `marker` is an ARIA text marker, **not** a map component.

---

## Findings from implementation

Things that cost time and would cost it again.

**Doctrine types cannot be constructor-injected.** The cipher reaches
`EncryptedStringType` through a Doctrine middleware; kernel and console events
do not fire for migrations or tests.

**WebAuthn has two handler contracts.** The firewall wants Symfony's
`AuthenticationSuccessHandlerInterface`; registration wants the bundle's own
`SuccessHandler`.

**`CanSaveCredentialRecord` is required**, or the bundle validates a ceremony
and stores nothing, answering 501.

**Lazily loaded collections read zero.** The last-passkey rule counted through
a collection and would have let an account lock itself out.

**Logout redirected.** A `LogoutEvent` listener answers JSON instead.

**`/app` without a trailing slash 404s** on both Vite and Apache. Both OAuth
authenticators redirect to `/app/`, and a dev-server middleware redirects the
bare path.

**Vite must build into `backend/public/app`.** It built into `frontend/dist`,
which Apache never serves, so the `.htaccess` SPA fallback looped until Apache
gave up with a 500. The production path had never worked.

**RCON needed a hard deadline.** The library's timeout bounds individual
reads, not the exchange; with `max_execution_time=0` a silent port held a
worker indefinitely. Now: `default_socket_timeout` during the call, a
twelve-second deadline, `set_time_limit(20)` as backstop. A silent port raises
`InvalidPacketException`, which is classified as unreachable, not as a failed
command.

**The OAuth client bundle cannot see runtime credentials.** Google's client is
built by a factory at call time. An earlier attempt used a kernel.request
listener that was never registered and silently did nothing —
`debug:event-dispatcher` showed it absent.

**scheb needs every token type listed.** `WebauthnToken` had to be added to
`security_tokens`, or a passkey login skips the second factor.

**The TOTP provider is off until configured.** Without a `totp:` section the
`TotpAuthenticatorInterface` service does not exist and autowiring fails.

**Flex skipped several recipes** (`symfony/apache-pack`, the WebAuthn bundle,
the OAuth bundle). `.htaccess` and `bundles.php` entries were written by hand.

**`node_modules` are platform-bound.** Installed for Linux in the container;
running npm on the host fails with missing native bindings.

---

## The reference panel's two-way bridge

The panel under `reference/zomboid-control-panel` (gitignored, MIT, read
but never copied) solves the two-way problem this project still has open.
Its `PanelBridge.lua` is 9132 lines and its changelog is a catalogue of
mistakes worth not repeating. Analysed 2026-09-04; the essentials:

**A write restriction that may or may not apply here.** Its changelog
says Build 42 buildid 24449161 (2026-07-29) restricted `getFileWriter`
to a small set of extensions and refuses `.json` outright, returning
nil. It works around this by appending `.txt` to every path it writes
(`status.json.txt`), leaving the content JSON.

**This project's bridge writes plain `.json` and it works.** Verified
2026-09-04 against the live GTX server: `players.json` carried a
timestamp from moments earlier while the server was running. So either
the restriction was lifted, or it never applied to that server's build.
Worth remembering if writes ever start failing silently, but not worth
pre-emptively changing.

`getFileReader` is unaffected either way. The panel writes the files it
owns (`inbox/cmd-*.json`) under their plain names, because it writes
from outside the game's sandbox.

**Directories cannot be created from Lua in Build 42.** The panel has to
create `inbox/` and `outbox/` itself.

**The queue.** Two counters, each owned by exactly one side and read by
the other: the bridge keeps `lastCommandSeq` in its own state file, the
panel keeps `nextCommandSeq` in its own. Command files are named
`cmd-<10-digit-seq>.json` and written atomically (temp file plus
rename), because a half-written file would otherwise be read.

Three separate guards stop a command running twice: the sequence
cursor, setting `lastCommandSeq` *before* the handler runs (a crash
therefore loses a command rather than repeating it), and a set of
already-seen command ids.

**Resync is forward-only.** If the two counters drift — the documented
case is a redeployed panel whose state file was reset while the mod kept
counting — every command waits forever on a file that will never
appear. The bridge reads the panel's declared position after 10 seconds
stuck and moves *forward* to it, never backward. The reasoning is the
part worth keeping: a stale read of the other side's counter can only
ever be too low, never invented too high, so a forward-only jump cannot
replay a command that already ran.

**Every gap in a sequential numbering must be filled actively.** When
its result buffer overflows it writes a tombstone result for the
dropped number rather than skipping it, because the reader is strictly
sequential and would otherwise wait forever.

**A heartbeat that does not travel the command path proves nothing.**
Its status file is written outside the queue, so it reported healthy
while every command was stuck. It now carries the queue counters.

**Not thrown is not succeeded.** Most of its changelog is one mistake in
different clothes: an action reporting success while doing nothing.
`triggerCustomWeatherStage` returns a real boolean that was discarded;
a fallback chain put a method that never throws first, so the real one
was never reached.

**Whether a value can be read back has to be settled per method.**
`ClimateFloat.getFinalValue()` is not refreshed until the next game
tick, so reading it straight after writing proves nothing — but
`getAdminValue()` is a plain field read and does. `permanentlyRemove()`
removes from the live collection synchronously, so re-checking works
there. Both look identical in Lua and behave oppositely.

**Java methods are not always Lua fields.** Guarding with
`if obj.method then` reports false for methods that are callable. This
made a live server with 21 vehicles report zero.

---

## Mail deliverability

The first real test message reached the user's inbox but landed in spam. The
cause is DNS on the sending domain, not the application:

- SPF is `v=spf1 a mx ptr ?all` — does not cover Hetzner's relay, and `ptr` is
  deprecated. Should be `v=spf1 include:_spf.hetzner.com mx ~all`.
- DMARC has `pct=50`, checking only half the mail.
- **DKIM is absent entirely** — the heaviest factor. Enabled per domain in
  Hetzner's konsoleH.

On the application side: mail now carries an HTML part alongside text, names
the application, and says why it arrived. A checker endpoint reads the three
records and reports what is missing.

**Hetzner shared hosting note:** the outgoing server is `mail.your-server.de`
for every mailbox regardless of domain. Entering the own domain fails with a
certificate mismatch, since the certificate covers `*.your-server.de`.

### 2026-09-04 — Mail deliverability and password visibility
HTML mail templates, an SPF/DKIM/DMARC checker, and a reveal toggle on every
password field. Commit `4e24f67`.

### 2026-09-04 — Teleport to coordinates
`teleportto` has two argument forms and only the single-argument one fails
over RCON, because it moves the caller and RCON has none. `PlayerModerator`
gained `teleportToCoordinates()`, the endpoint takes `{x, y, z}` as an
alternative to `{target}`, and the dialog has two tabs plus six landmarks.
The note claiming coordinates were impossible is gone. Commit `52eba8e`.

### 2026-09-04 — Event console
`App\Server\Events`: a catalogue of 14 actions declared once with their
fields and handed to the interface, so a control and its command cannot
drift. Each is marked with the commands it needs and greyed out when the
server's own `help` does not report them.

Two argument forms came from the command classes rather than guesswork:
`createhorde2` and `removezombies` are varargs taking `-x -y -z -radius`,
which is why hordes are RCON here rather than waiting for the bridge, and
`gunshot`/`alarm` take no argument at all.

Verified live: rain started and stopped from the page, and the action was
recorded with time and author. `removezombies` answered "Zombies removed."
`createhorde2` answers "invalid location" without a player nearby — the
flags parse, the chunk has to be loaded — and the page says so.
Commits `48da285`, `f8879ce`.

### 2026-09-04 — Texture pack upload
A rented server ships no texture packs, so `app:icons:extract` served only
operators running the panel beside the game. Packs can now be uploaded in
the settings. `apiFetch` had to learn to pass `FormData` through untouched:
setting a content type of its own strips the multipart boundary.
Verified with a real pack through the browser. Commit `a1b3dae`.

### 2026-09-04 — Roles carrying permissions
Brief 06. A `Role` entity with 17 permissions in five groups, editable in
the interface, assignable to users. Three built-in roles refuse deletion so
an installation cannot lock itself out, and keep their identifiers when
renamed because code refers to them by name.

Permissions and the legacy role names are both in force, as the brief asks:
`PermissionVoter` grants from an assigned role *or* from a legacy name, so
checks can move over one at a time and nothing breaks in the meantime.
Commit `4f1970d`.

### 2026-09-04 — World map
The research offered two dead ends — rendering the world isometrically costs
about 404 GB, and pzmap.org's tiles are barred by their `robots.txt` and
blocked by a `cross-origin-resource-policy` header.

Neither is needed: **the game ships its own map**. `pyramid.zip` holds 6582
tiles of 256 pixels in five levels, 51 MB, and level 0 is 19968x16128 —
exactly the world in squares, so no projection is needed at all.

`MapTileStore` reads a tile straight out of the archive (a zip's central
directory is an index, so unpacking 6582 files would buy nothing).
`app:map:import` takes the archive from a game or server installation.

Two things had to line up in Leaflet, each wrong once against the browser
before it was right: `CRS.Simple` puts one unit on one pixel at zoom 0 while
the pyramid's finest level is the *highest* zoom, and Simple's y axis runs
upward while tile rows run downward — which left every requested row
negative. Verified by measuring what sits under the viewport centre:
searching 11800,6900 lands on 11800,6900. Commit `d7b9db0`.

### 2026-09-04 — Permissions enforced everywhere
Every endpoint now guards on a permission rather than a role name, the
session reports the permissions a user effectively holds, and the
navigation shows only what they can reach. Roles are assignable in the
account dialog.

`access_control` had to loosen: it runs before any controller, so
`^/api/servers` demanding ROLE_SERVER_ADMIN turned a narrow role away
before the endpoint's own permission was consulted. Those three entries
are `ROLE_USER` now. A functional test caught that, not the browser.

The seven server pages in the sidebar collapsed into a table on the way
through — they were seven copies of the same twenty lines and each
needed its permission added. Commits `d46519c`, `6e9b9d4`, `70c6313`.

### 2026-09-04 — Two-way bridge
Bridge 0.8.0 reads as well as writes: the panel writes cmd-<seq>.json,
the bridge answers res-<seq>.json, each side owning its files and its
cursor. Twelve event actions go that way — the in-game clock, the
climate values, sounds at a point — because RCON has no command for any
of them.

Three decisions came from the reference panel's mistakes rather than
from repeating them: the resync only moves forward (a stale read of the
other cursor can be too low, never invented too high); the panel's
cursor is written after the command it accounts for; and each handler
confirms by reading back where that is safe — `getAdminValue` is a
plain field read, `getFinalValue` is not refreshed until the next tick.

`OnTickEvenPaused` replaces `OnTick`, so an empty server keeps
listening.

The Lua JSON reader is tested in Lua (`tests/Bridge/decode-test.lua`),
because Lua is what runs on the game server. Its first version silently
truncated any value containing an escaped quote — Lua patterns have no
alternation, so `"(.-)"` stops at the escaped one. It is a character
scanner now, and `BridgeDecoderTest` checks the copy in the test has
not drifted from the bridge. Commit `d3642d7`.

### 2026-09-05 — Two-way bridge confirmed live
The server restarted with 0.8.0 and answered. The assumption everything
rested on holds: **`getFileReader` reads a file the panel uploaded over
FTP into the Lua directory.**

A command takes 1 to 1.5 seconds from click to answer. Every handler
type was exercised against the live server — `setTime`, `setDate`,
`bridgeStartRain`, `bridgeStopRain`, `soundAtPoint`, `setClimateValue`
— and each answered with a real verdict rather than "the call did not
throw":

    {"seq":1,"ok":true,"message":"climate value set",
     "data":{"index":5,"value":0.6000,"asked":0.6000}}

The loop closes end to end: setting the hour to 13 from the panel put
`"hour":13` into the world state the bridge writes a minute later.

One thing worth noting for later: the bridge picked up the command file
left over from the pre-restart test and processed it on startup, which
is the queue behaving exactly as intended — a command survives a
restart rather than being lost.

### 2026-09-05 — Map rebuilt on OpenSeadragon, and the isometric render
Leaflet gave way to OpenSeadragon because the target format decided it:
pzmap2dzi writes DZI, which OpenSeadragon reads natively, and swapping
a floor is `open()` on the running viewer rather than a rebuild.

The map fills its frame with everything floating over it — search top
left, places bottom right and collapsible, coordinates bottom left,
players and safehouses right, floor control centred right as plus,
floor, minus, layer toggles centred left in green.

Three bugs found in a browser rather than reasoned about:

The right click never opened the teleport dialog. OpenSeadragon's
MouseTracker claims the button before `nonPrimaryPressHandler` sees a
real click, so the handler hangs off the `contextmenu` event instead.

A deep link landed on the default position twice over — first because
the route is lazily loaded and `window.location.hash` reads empty by
then, then because the viewer's own debounced writer had already
overwritten it. The hash is captured at module load now.

Setting the view on `open` was undone a frame later by OpenSeadragon's
home animation, so it waits for the first drawn frame.

**The map now comes from the game server**, not a local installation:
`app:map:import --from-server="<name>"` pulls the 51 MB pyramid over
FTP. The server was running build 24909836 against the local game's
24909800 — 36 builds newer, which is exactly why this matters.

**The isometric render works.** `main.py unpack` was the missing step;
without it every tile is `.empty`. Measured: 438 GB for the whole world
at full resolution, of which level 22 alone is 336 GB, and one cell
renders in about a second. On-demand rendering of that level is built
but cannot reach the renderer from inside the container — see "Next
concrete step".

`TileGeometry` inverts pzmap2dzi's transform to find the cells behind a
tile. Its tests caught a factor of two in that inversion, which would
have rendered every missing tile from the wrong part of the world.
Commits `8445bab` through `d444519`.
